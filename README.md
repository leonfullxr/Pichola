# Pichola

Pichola is a game designed by me and some other colleagues in a Game Jam, where we won a prize for 'Best Art'.

We were a team of 3 programmers and 2 art designers, so we had to coordinate ourselves to make the graphical art work along with the physics and collisions of the game.

The theme was 'Start from Nothing', therefore we had the marvellous idea of the creation of life, (the egg went before the chicken) where you start as an egg that hatches and you collect eggs around the map that make you have abilities such as jumping, double jumping, wall toggle, etc.

We designed this game in two days, and we are considering adding new levels to share it into the market.
